# cyclecloud-htcondor

Htcondor template for cyclecloud.

Based on https://github.com/Azure/cyclecloud-htcondor

Currently the main differences are:
- field to configure the flocking from
- field to configure the pool password
- field to configure cluster owner, in order to correctly call it from scripts
